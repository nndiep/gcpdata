Data pipelines
How data flows
Ingestion > Storage > Process & Analyze > Explore and visualize
At each stage, there are bundle of gcp products


Data types
Structured Data
Tabular data 
Represented by rows & columns
SQL can be used
Fixed schema
Each row has the same $of columns
Relational DB are structured
MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MSSQL
In GCP: CouldSQL, Cloud Spanner
Semi-Structured Data
Each record has variable number of Perperties
No Fixed schema
Flexible structure
NoSQL
Store data as key-value pair
JSON
MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j
In GCP: BigTable, DataStore, memoryStore
Unstructured Data
No predefine structure 
Image, video data
Natural language
Batch data vs Streaming data
Batch data processing
Defined Start & End of data - data size is known
Processing high volume of data after certain period of interval
Long time to process data
Eg: Payment processing
Streaming data processing
Unbounded, No End defined
Data is processed as it arrives
Size is unknow
Not heavy processing - take seconds to process data
Eg: Stock data processing

GCP Regions & Zones
Singapore region has multiple zones - means multiple data centers
Global & Regions & Zones are connected by hyper optical network

GCP Services relate to Data Engineering
Storage & Database
Data processing
ML/AI
Secondary Services

Basic infrastructure: IAM, Computing,GKE,App Engine, Cloud Run, Cloud Function,VPC
IAM: 
WHO can do WHAT on WHICH resources
Roles: built-in or Custom role, Service Account
Grant IAM based on the role of user/group to have enough permissions to certain services.
SA: max 10 keys per SA; max: 100 SA per project - SA could tight to certain roles(permissions)
Computing (VM) (aka AWS EC2)
App Engine (aka AWS 
PAAS; Fully managed service; Serverless; ‚Ä¶
Features: auto scaling, LB, versioning, traffic splitting, 
GKE - kubernetes engine (aka AWS AKE)
cluster (nodes) > Deploy workers(pods where containers run) > Expose to public via LB
Create Docker image
Create docker image
Run the container
Push image to repo (Container Registry product)
Google Cloud Run (aka AWS Fargate): Deploy app version and transfer traffic
Serverless app 
Lab: make the change to code >push new image>deploy new version>switch/transfer traffic from old version to new
Google Cloud Function (aka AWS Lambda)
Single purpose micro services; deploy code as function.
Deploy cloud function

‚úçÔ∏è Homework: LAB
Create a personal gcp account and get free tier with credit card information: 90d/$300
Play with IAM with different roles
GKE demo
Create a cluster
Deploy workload (container image)
Expose outside world
Create app; docker image, push to repo; then deploy app.
